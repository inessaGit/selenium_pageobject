---------------------------WebDriver native events vs synthetic events---------------------
In WebDriver advanced user interactions are provided by either 
- simulating the Javascript events directly (i.e. synthetic events) 
- letting the browser generate the Javascript events (i.e. native events). 
- Native events simulate the user interactions better. 
- Native events should be used whenever it is possible. 
- Synthetic events are platform independent, which can be important in Linux

------------------------------WebDRiver Element Not Visible Exception--------------------
Selenium determines an element is visible or not by the following criteria (use a DOM inspector to determine what css applies to your element, make sure you look at computed style):

1) visibility != hidden
2) display != none (is also checked against every parent element)
3) opacity != 0 (this is not checked for clicking an element)
4)height and width are both > 0
5) for an input, the attribute type != hidden
6) due to timing when the element is supposed to slowly appear. Using wait function might help 
7) element is not visible in viewport -> use window maximize function 

There is also another case when visible element will be recognized as not visible:
When the Element is CSS transformed
When Parent Element of the Element is CSS transformed
In order to check if element you wan't to interact with is CSS transformed, on CHROME do this:

open inspector
Find interesting element (or more likely its parent element, supposedly div element)
Select 'Computed' tab
if there is a parameter: webkit-transform: matrix( ... ) it means that the element is CSS transformed, and may not be recognized by selenium 2 as a visible element
