Maven relies on build lifecycle; 
Build lifecycle is a deifned process for building and distributing a particular artifact (project).

Maven has  three built-in(predefined) build lifecycles: 
- DEFAULT (handles your project deployment; has  some phases)
- CLEAN  (handles project cleaning; has some phases)
- SITE (handles the creation of your project's site documentation; has some phases)

A Build Lifecycle consists of PHASES. BUILD PHASE represents a stage in the lifecycle.

DEFAULT LIFECYCLE comprises of the following phases:

If run mvn install - it executes each default life cycle phases in order (validate, compile, package, etc.), before executing install.

VALIDATE - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
COMPILE - compile the source code of the project
TEST - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
PACKAGE - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
VERIFY - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
INSTALL - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
DEPLOY - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

CLEAN LIFECYCLE comprises of the following phases:

pre-clean - execute processes needed prior to the actual project cleaning
clean - remove all files generated by the previous build
post-clean - execute processes needed to finalize the project cleaning

===============
If you want to only download dependencies without doing anything else, then it's:
mvn dependency:resolve

If you want to invoke testng test suite defined in maven pom.xml  then run :
mvn test 

If you run 
mvn install
This command executes each default life cycle phases in order (validate, compile, package, etc.), before executing install.
