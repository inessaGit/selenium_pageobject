A suite is represented by one XML file. 
It can contain one or more tests and is defined by the <suite> tag.
(if there is no xml file then testng will create default suite) 

A test is represented by <test> and can contain one or more TestNG classes.

A TestNG class is a Java class that contains at least one TestNG annotation. 
It is represented by the <class> tag and can contain one or more test methods.

A test method is a Java method annotated by @Test in your source.
A TestNG test can be configured by @BeforeXXX and @AfterXXX annotations which allows to perform some Java logic before and after a certain point, these points being either of the items listed above.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This are the basic annotations for TestNG

@BeforeSuite - For suite test, run before all tests in this suite have run. 
@AfterSuite -  For suite test, run after all tests in this suite have run.
 
@BeforeTest - For suite test, run before any test method belonging to the classes inside the <test> tag is run. 
@AfterTest - For suite test, run after all the test methods belonging to the classes inside the <test> tag have run. 
 
@BeforeGroups: Run before the first test method that belongs to the group is invoked. 
@AfterGroups: Run after the last test method that belongs to the groups is invoked. 
 
@BeforeClass:
1) Runs after constructor of currently running class
2) Run before the first test method in the current class is invoked. 

@AfterClass - Run after all the test methods in the current class have been run. 
 
@BeforeMethod - Run before each test method. 
@AfterMethod - Run after each test method.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@BeforeMethod is invoked before each method with a @Test annotation.
@BeforeTest is invoked before a <test> tag.

1. Every @BeforeTest()  method in java class should invoke with respect to the <test> tag in testng.xml file
2.Every @BeforeMethod() method in java Class should invoke with respect to the @Test Annotation in java class

@Test(dependsOnGroups ="groupName") - global for a project;
@Test(dependsOnMethods = { "checkoutWithSweepstakeEntriesFromCart"} , groups ="in progress")
